- title: SearchBar
  subtitle: A bartender cheatsheet made with React. Search cocktails by name, pick one from the index or click "Surprise Me" to see cocktail recipes.
              The Cocktail DB was used to retrieve the data which includes the list of cocktails, and recipes for each cocktail.
              Axios and Express were used to handle API calls.
              Each page in Searchbar is linked together using React Router, so once the app is loaded initially it doesn't need to load again. Everything renders on the fly.

- title: Votelity
  subtitle: A voting assistant made with Ruby On Rails. Compare any 2 politicians and see how they voted on bills pertaining to issues you care about.
              The VoteSmart API was used to retrieve the data, which includes the list of politicians, the list of bills, and each politician's vote on each bill.
              The data from the API was stored using postgreSQL.
              Ruby on Rails handled database/api calls and the React-On-Rails gem was used to render the data on the front end.
